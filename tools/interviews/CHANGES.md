# Changes — overnight polish pass

Running log of what changed and why, newest first. Companion to DESIGN.md
(decisions) and README.md (how to run). Written during the autonomous polish
pass so the morning review has a paper trail.

Verification note: there is no browser/Node in the build environment, so live
Firestore and rules could not be exercised here. UI/UX was verified by driving
the app headlessly in **forced local mode** (Chromium/Firefox/WebKit via
Playwright, at mobile + desktop widths) with fictitious seed data — never real
applicant PII, never the live Firestore. Runtime Firestore/rules testing is left
to the morning review; anything not runtime-tested is called out below.

## v2 — Apple redesign, unified candidate login, real security model
Large cohesive pass. Everything verified headlessly in local mode (committee,
admin, applicant flows; mobile + desktop; no console errors).

**DESIGN** — rewrote [`css/styles.css`](css/styles.css) as one Apple-style sheet:
hairline cards with soft depth, SF-style type + spacing, iOS segmented controls &
toggles, translucent sticky segmented tabs, spinner, refined toast, deadline
banner, empty states, smooth transitions, `prefers-reduced-motion` + `@media print`
support, and a proper mobile layout (larger touch targets, single-column slots).

**UX** — [`js/app.js`](js/app.js) rewrite:
- Collapsible `<details>` sections (remember open/closed) for the dense admin
  areas (Screen collation/dashboard/add, Setup, guidance) to cut overwhelm.
- Short plain-English "What to do here" instructions on **every** section.
- Real empty states everywhere (no candidates, no slots, no scores, nothing to score).

**QOL** — loading spinner + disabled state on the gate and on every awaited action
(login, save, add, exports, reveal); optimistic UI (writes reflect immediately);
`saving → saved` toasts and error toasts; styled confirm dialog.

**FEAT**
- CSV exports: shortlist, schedule, scores.
- Coordinator dashboards: who has/hasn't submitted screening & availability.
- **Manual panel override**: inline editor per panel (change slot, add/remove
  members with the chair locked in, 3–5 validation) + "schedule manually" for
  unschedulable candidates + "reset to auto"/"reset all".
- Deadline banner (screening due Sept 23, turns urgent ≤3 days).
- Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (remove candidate/time, reveal ranking).
- Print-friendly schedule (`window.print()` + print stylesheet).
- Accessibility: ARIA roles/labels, `aria-pressed`/`aria-selected`, focus-visible
  rings, keyboard-submit forms, contrast.

**C1 — unified applicant login (same link).** The gate now accepts either the
committee code (→ committee/admin) or a **different applicant code** (→ candidate
view: enter last name → pick your own times only; never sees roster/questions/
scores). `book.html` forwards to `index.html`; `js/book.js` removed. Applicants
submit availability keyed by their typed **last name** (so they never read the roster).

**SEC — real access control.** Added a role-based auth model:
- [`firestore.rules`](firestore.rules) rewritten to branch on
  `request.auth.token.email` for three role accounts (admin / committee /
  applicant). Applicants can read only public slots + write their own availability;
  reviewers cannot read scores/screening (ranking is admin-only *for real*).
- [`js/config.js`](js/config.js) `AUTH` block (mode + role emails). Default
  `mode:"anon"` so the **live app keeps working unchanged** until you activate
  roles — exact console steps in README → "Real access control".
- [`js/store.js`](js/store.js) is now role-aware: subscribes only to collections a
  role may read, and keeps a per-device "echo" of a reviewer's own screening/scores
  so they still see their own input without a server read. Slots are mirrored to a
  PII-free `interviews_public/slots` doc for applicants.
- **Not runtime-tested** here (no live Firebase in this env): the roles path,
  rules, and the account setup need you to apply the console steps + flip
  `AUTH.mode`. Called out honestly in README and the rules header.

Schema: additive only (`settings.panelOverrides`, `interviews_public/slots`);
existing collections/keys unchanged. `availCand` now read by candidate-id (legacy)
**or** last-name key, so existing data keeps working.

## S1 — Committee code rotated + questions re-encrypted
- The old code `edleadership` (public — it is also Motion Voting's passcode) no
  longer decrypts the interview questions. Re-encrypted `{q,s,g}` under a new
  strong private code (same PBKDF2-SHA256 keystream + XOR scheme, same salt/iters).
- Updated `ENC_CIPHER` in [`js/data.js`](js/data.js) and [`mock.html`](mock.html).
- The new code appears **nowhere** in the repo. It is delivered in the morning
  summary (chat only).
- Verified end-to-end in a headless browser: old code → "Incorrect code"; new
  code → accepted; new code + `!` → admin accepted.
